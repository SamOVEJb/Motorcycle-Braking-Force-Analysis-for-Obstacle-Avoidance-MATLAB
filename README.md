A MATLAB-based project to calculate and visualize the braking force required for a motorcycle to avoid collisions with obstacles. Ideal for automotive safety analysis, engineering education, or rider training.

---

## üìã Overview
This project computes the minimum braking force needed to stop a motorcycle and rider before colliding with an obstacle (e.g., a dog 200 meters ahead). Using the principle of energy conservation (\( \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = F \times d \)), it demonstrates how velocity, mass, and distance impact braking requirements.

## üîë Key Features
- **Physics-Based Formula:** Implements \( F = \frac{mv^2}{2d} \).
- **Dynamic Inputs:**  
  - Total mass (\( m = 255 \, \text{kg} \): motorcycle + rider).  
  - Velocity range (\( v = 10 \, \text{m/s} \) to \( 50 \, \text{m/s} \)).  
  - Fixed obstacle distance (\( d = 200 \, \text{m} \)).  
- **Visualization:** Generates a plot of braking force vs. velocity.
- **Educational:** Perfect for teaching kinetic energy and braking dynamics.
